      "In this module, we employ a comprehensive pipeline that includes image preprocessing, lung segmentation, and fine-tuning using Inception V3. Trained on a large dataset of labeled X-ray images, the model detects pneumonia with high sensitivity and specificity. Its detailed visualization aids clinicians in examining affected areas for accurate diagnosis."
